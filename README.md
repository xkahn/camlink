## Setup

### Prerequisites

You will need `gcc` and `make` to build.

[Top][toc]

### Building

Run `mkdir build && make`

[Top][toc]

### Installing

Simply run `sudo make install`. The `camlink.so` file will be copied to the path `/usr/local/lib/camlink/camlink.so`

[Top][toc]

### Uninstalling

Run `sudo make uninstall`.

## Usage

This library is run as a `LD_PRELOAD` to other applications. It intercepts all `ioctl` calls
and determines if the call is intended to query the colorspaces available on a camlink.

If so, it rejects all return values that are NOT `YUYV 4:2:2`. This should make colors work
correctly on the Camlink in Linux.

## Examples

### Video4Linux2 CTL application:

```
$ LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/camlink/camlink.so v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video2 --list-formats-ext
```

### Zoom
```
$ LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/camlink/camlink.so zoom
```

[Top][toc]

### Flatpak Zoom
```
$ flatpak override us.zoom.Zoom --filesystem=/usr/local/lib/camlink/camlink.so
$ flatpak run --env=LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/camlink/camlink.so us.zoom.Zoom
```

[Top][toc]

### Firefox
```
$ LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/camlink/camlink.so firefox
```

[Top][toc]

### Universal
```
export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/camlink/camlink.so
```

### Getting this to work in a desktop environment

Say you use Google Chrome. You click on the icon in your desktop environment, and it locates the .desktop file. (located @ `/usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop` on my machine)

Inside that file is an `Exec=` line that specifies how to the browser should be started. On my machine, the line is:

```
Exec=/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable %U
```

You need to edit that line, and you need that line to STAY edited even if you update Google Chrome. The solution is to make a local copy of this file in your home directory:

```
$ cp /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
```

Then edit the new file @ `~/.local/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop` and change the exec line to include the LD\_PRELOAD call. Something like this:

```
Exec=env LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/camlink/camlink.so /usr/bin/google-chrome-stable %U 
```

## Troubleshooting
If running the browser on the command line DOES NOT WORK -- even after fully quitting it first:

Then the issue is different; likely the `LD_PRELOAD` path is incorrect. The examples assume that you have installed the camlink library. If you have not, instead use the path where your camlink.so file can be found. For example: `LD_PRELOAD=/home/yourname/path/to/camlink/sources/build/camlink.so`

## This is a Cam Link 4K bug. What does Elgato support say?

I contacted Elgato about the issue and got this reply:

> Thank you for contacting Elgato Technical support.
> 
> I understand you are in need of some information regarding running a Cam Link 4K on a Linux computer. I will be happy to help!
> 
> As it turns out, Linux OS is not supported. Elgato products were designed to work with Windows and Mac only.

So they will not be helpful. That doesn't mean you shouldn't contact them about the issue! Manufacterers need to know how their product is being used.

## Alternatives

There are several other possible fixes for the color issue for the Cam Link 4K:

* [Hack the firmware to stop returning invalid colorspaces](https://assortedhackery.com/patching-cam-link-to-play-nicer-on-linux/)
* [Use a dummy video source and ffmpeg to convert the color to something different](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxhardware/comments/dzqmvq/did_anyone_tried_an_elgato_cam_link_4k_on_gnulinux/fjdsx96/)
* Build an exception into the v4l2 driver for the Camlink to ignore the extra colorspaces. There is such a patch [here](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210325213458.51309-1-bdrung@posteo.de/) written by [Benjamin Drung](https://github.com/bdrung) <[bdrung@posteo.de](mailto:bdrung@posteo.de)>.
